      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(team, players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";
      console.log(team, players);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); /* slice with nothing passed in makes a copy */
      console.log(team2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      console.log(team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "hoo haa";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[2] = "Bob";
      console.log(team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person; /*this is not a copy. it's a reference to the original! */
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {
        number: 25,
      }); /* take a blank {}, fold in properties from person, update properties from last {} */
      console.log("person", person);
      console.log("cap2", cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const capt3 = { ...person, newProp: "hi" };
      console.log(capt3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };
      console.log(wes);
      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
      dev.name = "Wesley";
      console.log(dev, wes);

      dev.social.twitter =
        "@coolman"; /* because above is only valid one level deep, the social part is a reference still and any changes are made to original data */
      console.log(dev, wes);

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
      dev2.social.twitter = "new";
