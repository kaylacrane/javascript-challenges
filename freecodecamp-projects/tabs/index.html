              <h4>my story</h4>
              <p>
                I'm originally from the U.S. but I've been living and working in
                Spain for over ten years. In that time I've mostly been an 👩‍🏫
                English teacher or teaching assistant. (I know, what a cliché.)
                This year I decided to finally make a change in my professional
                life.
              </p>
              <p>
                In May I enrolled in a three month intensive web development
                course. It was supposed to be in person but with current world
                affairs, I ended up getting a fully remote experience. The
                course was most definitely intense 😅 but I enjoyed the fast
                pace and the time went by quickly. In just three months I
                learned so much and had a ton of fun doing it, even if I slept
                less than ever before in my life. 💤
              </p>
              <p>
                Now that I've finished training, I'm looking for my first
                developer job. It's not easy, let me tell ya. Most companies
                want employees with years of experience, even if the offer says
                it's for a junior developer. So to continue expanding my
                knowledge, as well as to keep myself sane, I study 📚 and create
                💥 every day. You can see what I've been up to by visiting my

                In general, the world fascinates me and I can find a point of
                interest in just about anything.
              </p>
              <p>In particular, I have a passion for the following topics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span class="highlight">☕ Tea...</span> Darjeeling is my

                  speak Spanish, French, English, Catalan, and know the basics
